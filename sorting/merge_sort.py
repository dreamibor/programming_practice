Sorting - Merge Sort

Merge Sort is based on divide and conquer. For a given array with length n, 
each time, we split it into two sub-arrays with length of n/2. We then 
recursively partition the arrays until there is only one element. Then we 
begin to merge the arrays.

Time Complexity - O(N*logN) - Each time we split the array recursively into 
two parts, so there are O(logN) partitions, and we need to merge two 
partitions with O(N), so in total O(N*logN).
Another explanation, the time complexity in the recursion form:
T(n)=2T(n / 2â€‹) + O(n)
According to the master theorem, the ime complexity is O(N*logN).

Space Complexity - O(N) - We need O(N) extra space for the temp array. The 
recursion stack may at most take O(logN), so in total O(N+logN) = O(N).
