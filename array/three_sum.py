"""
Two Pointers - Three Sum (medium)

Description:
Given an array of unsorted numbers, find all unique triplets in it that add up to zero.
The problem is also called "Triplet Sum to Zero".

Example:
Input: [-3, 0, 1, 2, -1, 1, -2]
Output: [-3, 1, 2], [-2, 0, 2], [-2, 1, 1], [-1, 0, 1]
Explanation: There are four unique triplets whose sum is equal to zero.

Notes:
1. The array is not sorted.
2. There must be negative numbers in the array (or all zeros).
3. We need to find all unique triplets, so we have to skip any duplicate numbers.

    """ Two Pointers - Sort and Find

    The target is to find a triplet a + b + c = 0.

    We can sort the array first, and the fix one number (a) on the left, scanning 
    numbers on the right side of the array using the same technique as in Two Sum 
    Pairs problem.

    Time Complexity - O(N^2) - N is the total number of elements in the given array.
    Sorting the array will take O(N*logN). Searching for pairs will take O(N), and 
    we are searching pairs for each number in the input array, so in total it 
    will be O(N*logN + N^2), it's asymptotically equivalent to O(N^2).

    Space Complexity - O(N) - space required for sorting, ignore the space needed for 
    saving result.
