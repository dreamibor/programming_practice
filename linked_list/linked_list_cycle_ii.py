Linked List - Linked List Cycle II (easy)

Given the head of a singly linked list that contains a cycle, write a function 
to find the starting node of the cycle, if there is no cycle return None.

Example:
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1 (cycle postion)
Output: Return the node at index 1.
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, linking from the last node 
to the second node (with index 1).

    """ Fast and Slow Pointers
    We first us fast and slow pointers to find the meeting 
    point of fast and slow point.

    Assume from head to cycle entrance is a, when slow has 
    entered the cycle, it walked b to meeting point and c 
    is the remaining length of the cycle. 

    Fast has walked in the cycle for n times to meet slow, 
    so the total distance fast has travelled is 
    a + n(b+c) + b = a + (n+1)b + nc
    The slow pointer has travelled a + b, as we've known, 
    the fast travels two times faster than slow, so
    a + (n+1)b +nc = 2(a+b) => a = c + (n-1)(b+c)
