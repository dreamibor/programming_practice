DP - Backpack (medium)

Description:
Given n items with size A_iâ€‹ an integer m denotes the size of a backpack. How 
full you can fill this backpack?

You can not divide any item into small pieces.

Example:
Input:
array = [3,4,8,5]
backpack size = 10
Output: 9

Challenge:
1. O(n x m) time and O(m) memory.
2. O(n x m) memory is also acceptable if you do not know how to optimize 
memory.

    Here we are assuming that:
    1. Each kind has only one item.
    2. Each item can only be chosen once.

    DP state definition:
    dp[i][j] - The maximum loaded space with first i items and capacity j.

    Initialization:
    1. Initialize first column:
    For the first column, where the capacity is 0, no matter what items we 
    got, the maximum loaded space will be 0.

    2. Initialize first row:
    For the first row, when the capacity is larger than the first item, we 
    can put the first item in, otherwise 0. 

    DP state transition:
    if j - A[i] >= 0:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-A[i]] + A[i], dp[i-1][j])

    Given the DP state transition equation:
    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-A[i]] + A[i], dp[i-1][j])
    We can see that the current state only relates to the state above it and 
    the state at top-left (in previous row), so we can optimise the space 
    with rolling array.
