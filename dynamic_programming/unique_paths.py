DP - Unique Paths (medium)

Decription:
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' 
in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The 
robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 
'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Example:
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
