# Programming Practice 编程实践
A repository of programming practice for LeetCode-like problems.

## Problem List
There are some classic problems that you just can't ignore, so I prepared a list of classic problems.    
Also, those problems are the most frequent problems for those big tech companies' interviews.

Please check:
[problem_list.md](problem_list.md)

## Problem Solving Templates
It's much easier to use some templates to help you to format the problem solving code at the beginning, but after you are familiar with the style of LeetCode-like problems, you shall throw those templates away.
