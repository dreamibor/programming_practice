# Programming Practice 编程实践
This is a repository about programming practice for LeetCode-like problems.

## Problem List
There are some classic problems that you can't ignore, so I prepared a list of classic problems, and those problems are also the most frequent problems during the interviews of those big tech companies.

Please check:
[problem_list.md](problem_list.md)

## Problem Solving Templates
It's much easier to use some templates to help you to format the problem solving code at the beginning, but after you are familiar with the style of LeetCode-like problems, you shall throw those templates away.

Please check:
