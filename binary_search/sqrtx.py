Binary Search - Sqrt(x) (easy)

Description:
Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only 
the integer part of the result is returned.

Example:
Input: x = 4
Output: 2

Constraints: 0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
